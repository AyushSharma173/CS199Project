We intend to create a differential equation solver using Rust. 

System Overview

Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.

Possible Challenges
Please list some of the challenges you foresee running into.
We envision that implementing a parse tree in order to parse mathematical expressions will be the most difficult part of this project.
