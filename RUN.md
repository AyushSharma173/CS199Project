Running the file: 

First clone the repository. If using VSCode and the Vagrant VM, you can go to source control once you have entered the SSH, and click clone repository. 
From there you can click on the green code button in our Github project home screen and copy the url. Paste that url into the VSCode dialog and the repository
will be cloned. Alternatively, you can run git clone with the url from the project (which can be found by clicking the green code button). 

Once in the program, simply run cargo run and the calculator will show up. Please be advised that it does not yet support order of operations, and there should be
spaces between tokens.
